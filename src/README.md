# Jamming
This project is a final assignment for one of the **React** courses on **_Codecademy_**
## Description
### As described by the course:
>In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of _React components, passing state, and requests_ with the _Spotify API_ to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
## How to use
1. Create an app on Spotify's website. Follow this [guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/)
2. In the `/src/util/Spotify.js` file replace the `clientID` string with your clientID.
3. Run the application `npm start`.
## Notes
- _I have been given the **CSS** for all of the components_
- _The website offers hints on how to tackle some of the steps_
